# Spring Data REST Exporter Example

This deployable web application is an example project that illustrates how to deploy 
your own artifacts into a WAR that can be exporter using the [Spring Data REST Exporter](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-rest).

### Use

Either use this project as a template for your own project, or simply include your own 
artifacts as dependencies in the `build.gradle` file.

Build the WAR file using `./gradlew war`, then deploy that into your servlet container.
